/*
Buffer cache hit ratio
  
This counter should be as high as possible. It's extremely common to find this counter value as 99 percent or more
for most prodution servers. A low value indicates that few requests could be served out of the buffer cache, with the
rest of the requests being served from disk.

                                                                                                        
--Checkpoint pages/sec

It indicates the number of pages that are moved to disk by a checkpoint operation. Higher
values on this counter indicate a large number of writes occurring within the system, possibly indicative of I/O problems. 
                                                                                                            
--Lazy writes/sec 

A dirty, aged buffer is one that has changes and needs to be written to the disk. Higher values
on this counter possibly indicates IO Issues or even memory problems. It should be consistently be less than 20
for the average system.
                                                                                                              
--Memory Grants Pending

It represents the number of process pending for a memory grant within SQL Server memory. If this counter is high, then
SQL Server is short of memory. Under normal conditions, this counter should consistently be 0 for most production servers.
                                                                                                          
--Page life expectancy
It ndicates how long a page will stay in the buffer pool without being referenced. It must to be higher than 300                                                                                                           

--Target Server Memory (KB) 
It represents the amount of dynamic memory SQL Server is willing to consume.                                                                                                      

--Total Server Memory (KB) 
It indicates the amount of memory currently assigned to SQL Server.
