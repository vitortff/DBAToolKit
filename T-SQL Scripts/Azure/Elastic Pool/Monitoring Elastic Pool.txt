--sys.resource_stats (Azure SQL Database)
--Returns CPU usage and storage data for an Azure SQL Database. 
--The data is collected and aggregated within five-minute intervals. 
--For each user database, there is one row for every five-minute reporting window 
--in which there is a change in resource consumption. The data returned includes CPU usage, 
--storage size change, and database SKU modification. Idle databases with no changes may not have rows 
--for every five-minute interval. Historical data is retained for approximately 14 days.
