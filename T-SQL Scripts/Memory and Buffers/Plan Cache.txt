--Looking into the Plan Cache
--The plan cache is built on top of the caching infrastructure provided by the SQL OS. This provides
--objects called cache stores, which can be used to cache all kinds of objects. The plan cache contains
--several different cache stores used for different types of objects.

--To see the content into the plan cache, it is just execute this query:

select name, entries_count, single_pages_kb, multi_pages_kb
from sys.dm_os_memory_cache_counters
where [name] in (
'object plans'
, 'sql plans'
, 'extended stored procedures'
)



--To find performance issues(questões) caused by long lookup(pesquisa) times(longo tempo de pesquisa), you can look into the contents of the DMV
--sys.dm_os_memory_cache_hash_tables, as shown in the following example. It is recommended
--that no bucket should contain more than 20 objects; and buckets exceeding 100 objects should be addressed.

select *from sys.dm_os_memory_cache_hash_tables
where type in (
'cachestore_objcp'
, 'cachestore_sqlcp'
, 'cacchestore_phdr'
, 'cachestore_xproc'
)

--Use the following DMV to look for heavily used buckets:

select bucketid, count(*) as entries_in_bucket
from sys.dm_exec_cached_plans
group by bucketid
order by 2 desc

--You can look up the specific plans in that bucket using this query:

select *
from sys.dm_exec_cached_plans
where bucketid = 236
